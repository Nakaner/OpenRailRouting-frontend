        <h1>About OpenRailRouting</h1>
        <p>OpenRailRouting is a routing engine for railway vehicles on the railway network mapped in the OpenStreetMap database. The routing engine is based on GraphHopper, an OpenStreetMap routing engine in Java.</p>
        <p>OpenRailRouting is free and open source software under the Apache License version 2. You can get the source code on <a href="https://github.com/geofabrik/OpenRailRouting">GitHub</a>. Build instructions for the backend written in Java can be found there.</p>
        <p>The development of OpenRailRouting was sponsored by SNCF, the national railway company of France which heavily makes use of OpenStreetMap and its railway data.</p>
        <h2>OpenRailRouting API</h2>
        <p>OpenRailRouting (the backend) has an HTTP REST API which is almost identical to the API of GraphHopper. You can find the documentation currently on <a href="https://github.com/geofabrik/OpenRailRouting-doc">GitHub</a> only.</p>
        <p><code>routing.openrailwaymap.org</code> is currently a demo not intended for production use. It runs on a small personal virtual machine. Its data does not get updated regularly. Please set up your own instance â€“ you can do it.</p>
